# How to Run

**### IMPORTANT INFORMATION**

This project also **require Moesif-CORS** plugin for bypassing CORS Policy, get it as an extension in your desired browser. In case of Chromium-based browser :

[Moesif Origin & CORS Changer - Chrome Web Store (google.com)](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/moesif-origin-cors-change/digfbfaphojjndkpccljibejjbppifbc)
 
or else, the API will not work

## Clone into your local repo
    git clone https://github.com/apin014/Milestone02_K08.git
    cd Milestone02_K08
    cd src
**MAKE SURE YOU'RE NOW IN YOUR LOCAL REPO SRC FOLDER**
<br />
<br />
## Install all Dependencies and Prerequisities
Usually, you can do this by 

    npm install
But Incase that doesn't work, you can look what dependencies are used by opening **package.json** file and install them one-by-one.
as for now, dependencies used are Express and EJS that can be installed by

    npm install express
    npm install ejs
<br />

## Running the Localhost
now, you can run the localhost server by typing in your terminal

    node app
and open with your browser http://localhost:3000
You can change the port of the localhost in case the 3000 port interfere with other app. 
you can change the port (for example to 8080) by altering the argument passed in **app.js** in function

    app.listen(3000)
change it to whatever port you want. For example, if you want to change itto 8080, you can change the code into
  

    app.listen(8080)
And now you can access it by address http://localhost:8080
